# Nano-Degree-Programming-for-Data-Science-with-Python
## Sameer Ahmed
<p>
  I went into this course expecting to learn Python â€” having finished it, I find I have learned a lot more: Python (in-depth), Ndarrays, etc., using NumPy, DataFrames, etc., using pandas, working with many other NoSQL structures, a more powerful SQL language (PostgreSQL), Unix Shell commands, Git, and perhaps even more importantly (and unexpectedly), really useful techniques to use in the coding world such as how to routinely work with other contributors!<p>
